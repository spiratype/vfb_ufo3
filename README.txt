VFB2UFO3
DESCRIPTION
Multiple master-compatible Unified Font Object (UFO) version 3 font writer API
for Windows FontLab 5.2

VFB2UFO3 is primarily intended to create scaled UFO instances from a > 1000 UPM
multiple master FontLab .vfb font with PostScript outlines for use with the
AFDKO tools for creating binary fonts while still working with Windows FontLab
5.2. The most significant non-trivial change that will occur in export is the
renaming of kerning glyph groups (FontLab classes). Providing a .flc
(FontLab-class) file can speed up conversion significantly when font groups are
not identifiable as first/second from their name. All glyph hints/links are
ignored. A batch command can be created for use with psautohint, which
supports hinting outlines with decimal coordinates.

INSTALLATION

REQUIREMENTS
This package has no Python dependencies outside of the standard library. It is
written in C++ and Cython. The submodules are compiled into .pyd extension
modules. To recompile the submodules, the PyPi cython package and a compiler
for Cython to utilize during extension module compilation will be required.

Extension modules compiled from C++ require several DLLs from the GCC which are
included in the release .zip archive, FontLab installer, and PyPi package.

OPTIONAL
  cython
  pip install cython
  https://github.com/cython/cython

  AFDKO
  pip install afdko
  https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko

  MinGW 32-bit/i686 GCC >= 9.3.0

FUNCTIONALITY
UFO output is produced without changes to the source font. The source font will
be copied and UFOs will be created from the copy. If the font is multiple
master, instances will be generated from the copy. If a specific layer or
instance_values are not provided for a multiple master source font, a UFO
will be generated for each master in the font.

Fonts with a large number of glyphs benefit greatly from supplying additional
glyph names to be optimized when removing overlaps (glyphs_optimize_names)
and/or glyph names and suffixes which can be omitted from the final UFO
instance (glyphs_omit_names, glyphs_omit_suffixes). See GLYPHS OPTIONS
below.

Generated instances/layers can be saved and/or left open after generation via
the vfb_save and vfb_close options. If vfb_save is set to True, the
resulting .vfb instance will be updated during UFO creation. This includes
glyph outline changes (overlap removal and decomposition).

All path options must be absolute paths; folder and file paths which are not
absolute will be ignored. The default output path is the user's Desktop.

A dictionary of attributes may be suppled via the instance_attributes option.
These attributes should consist of keys from the UFO specification and they
must match the data type in the specification. Not all fontinfo attributes are
configurable; please see CONFIGURABLE_ATTRS in the fontinfo.pxi source file
for a list of attributes which will be checked and updated to the UFO(s) during
creation.

SCALE OPTIONS
By default, the target UPM for UFO output is 1000. For a UPM other than 1000,
say 2048, it should be set via the scale_to_upm option. The value from the
scale_to_upm option is ignored if it is lower than 1000. Scaling can be
turned off by setting scale_auto to False; this does not reduce conversion
times.

All scaling operations are performed independently from FontLab; if the .vfb
instance(s)/master copy are being saved, the .vfb font and glyph values will
be the original un-scaled values.

INSTANCE OPTIONS
When creating instances from a multiple master source font, lists of values,
names (optional), and attributes (optional) should be provided to generate
instance UFOs from the master font.

If the source is a multiple master font and a list of instance values is not
provided, a UFO for each master will be created.

For multiple master fonts, the instance values list should be values in
tuple- or list-form with a value for each axis. For single-axis fonts, if
the list values are numerical, the values will be converted to single-element
lists:

2-axis font
  instance_values = [[0, 1000], [200, 1000]]

  instance_values = [(0, 1000), (200, 1000)]

1-axis font
  instance_values = [[0], [200]]

  instance_values = [(0,), (200,)]

  instance_values = [0, 200] becomes [[0], [200]]

If the optional lists of names and/or attributes are provided in addition to a
list of values, they must be of the same length as the values list. A
ValueError will be raised if the lengths do not match, since this will likely
produce undesirable results:

Correct:


instance_values = [(0, 1000), (200, 1000)]
instance_names = ['Light Display', 'Regular Display']


Incorrect (ValueError):


instance_values = [(0, 1000), (200, 1000)]
instance_names = ['Light Display']


GLYPH OPTIONS
Glyph scaling is independent from the .vfb instance itself; if the .vfb
instance is being saved, the glyphs in the .vfb will remain un-scaled.

Glyph decomposition and overlap removal is optional and occurs after instances
are generated. This option is intended for final output when a binary font will
be created from the UFO.

By default, when decomposing and removing overlaps from glyph outlines for
export, GLIF files for glyphs containing components will be built using
contours from each component's base contours.

When decomposing only, the optimization outlined above will be used for all
glyphs containing components.

The generated .vfb instance(s) will leave components in component-form.

To disable the optimizations outlined above, set the glyphs_optimize option
to False.

Omit glyphs from instance
  A list of glyph suffixes and/or glyph names can be supplied that should be
  omitted from the instance UFO via the glyphs_omit_suffixes and
  glyphs_omit_names options, respectively.

Optimize glyph name and code point lists
  If removing overlaps, the default list of code points for glyphs to be
  constructed in the above manner is composed of glyphs that normally have no
  overlapping components. The list is located in the ufo.pxi source file with
  the character representations for these code points shown below.

  The code points from the default code point list can be shown by running the
  vfb2ufo3.show_default_optimize_code_points() function. The code points will
  print to the FontLab output window and can then be copied into a text editor
  and edited as needed.

  A user-supplied code point list (glyphs_optimize_code_points) can be a list
  of '0x00ac'-format strings, integers in hexadecimal-form (0x00ac), or
  numeric integers (172); values which cannot be converted to an integer will
  raise a ValueError. Only the first code point in each glyph's list of code
  points (FontLab unicodes attribute) is checked for code point set membership.

  A user-supplied glyph name list (glyphs_optimize_names) can be supplied to
  supplement the code point list for glyphs. Any glyphs containing components
  that do not overlap should be added to this list.

  Small case variants of the code points in the code point list will be also
  added to code point list assuming they end with .sc, .smcp, or .c2sc
  suffixes.

Features options
Font groups can be added to the features.fea file on export by setting
features_import_groups to True. The font's features are neither formatted
nor checked for correctness. Users are responsible for moving referenced
feature files from include() statements to the chosen output directory. Also
see KERN FEATURE OPTIONS and MARK FEATURE OPTIONS below for kern and mark
feature options.

Kern feature options
Kern values will be scaled in parity with the output UFO. This scaling is
independent from the created .vfb instance. A minimum value can be set using
kern_min_value. This value should be a positive integer and when set, all
kern values (negative and positive) not above the threshold will be omitted
from the kern feature.

By default, the kern feature from the master font is not included in the
features.fea file. To include the kern feature from the master font,
kern_feature_passthrough should be set to True.

An external feature file with a kern feature can be imported to the font
features using the kern_feature_file_path option, which expects a path to a
text file with the .fea extension.

By default, a new kern feature is generated for each instance. Setting
kern_feature_generate to False will turn this off. The kern feature
generation will add subtables and a lookup as necessary. This is not
particularly elegant, and so far, no checks are made to guarantee a working
kern feature. Any remaining subtable overflows may be due to glyph(s) being
in more than one kern group of the same side; however overflows can also be
caused by issues from one or more GPOS features located earlier in the
feature list.

Mark feature options
A mark feature can be generated on export by setting mark_feature_generate
to True. A list of anchor names to omit (mark_anchors_omit) or a list of
anchor names to include (mark_anchors_include) can be supplied to fine-tune
the mark feature output. For both anchor name lists, the corresponding
_<anchor name> anchor will be added to their respective list.

Group options
Providing a FontLab-class file (.flc) or groups.plist speeds up UFO
creation time significantly when the group names are not named using first and
second group identifiers (see groups_flc_path and groups_plist_path
options). Group names in the .flc file do not have match any specific
formatting (e.g. MMK_R_<key glyph>, public.kern2.<key glyph>).

When not using either a .flc or groups.plist file, group names will be
checked for UFO3-style group identifiers (public.kern1.<key glyph>,
public.kern2.<key glyph>), MetricsMachine-style identifiers (MMK_L_<key
glyph>, MMK_R_<key glyph>), and the simpler _L and _R identifier
suffixes. Groups which either have no kerning or are not identifiable using
their name will be identified as first/second using FontLab's built-in
GetClassLeft/GetClassRight methods.

If the export_flc option is set to True, a FontLab-class file (.flc) will
be generated with group names matching those of the generated UFOs. This file
will be located in the same directory as the generated UFO(s).

The kern_ignore_no_kerning option can be set to True to ignore groups which
have no kerning pairs. This may be desirable if making a binary font from the
UFO. This option has no effect when using an imported .flc or groups.plist
file.

FontLab kern classes without a key glyph in a provided .flc file or in the
master font's kern classes will have the first glyph in the FontLab class
marked as the key glyph and it will be noted in the output console. If there is
more than one glyph marked as a key glyph, the first marked glyph is considered
the key glyph. These key glyph operations may affect the kerning. An imported
groups.plist infers that the glyph in the group name is the key glyph.

Kern group naming recommendations


Typical FontLab-style kerning groups:
_A: A' Agrave Aacute Acircumflex Atilde Adieresis Aring...
_A_r: A' AE Agrave Aacute Acircumflex Atilde Adieresis Aring...

Recommended naming for FontLab-style kerning groups:
_public.kern1.A: A' Agrave Aacute Acircumflex Atilde Adieresis Aring...
_public.kern2.A: A' AE Agrave Aacute Acircumflex Atilde Adieresis Aring...

Final output (UFO groups.plist):
<key>public.kern1.A</key>
<array>
	<string>A</string>
	<string>Agrave</string>
	<string>Aacute</string>
	<string>Acircumflex</string>
	<string>Atilde</string>
	<string>Adieresis</string>
	<string>Aring</string>
	...
</array>

<key>public.kern2.A</key>
<array>
	<string>A</string>
	<string>AE</string>
	<string>Agrave</string>
	<string>Aacute</string>
	<string>Acircumflex</string>
	<string>Atilde</string>
	<string>Adieresis</string>
	<string>Aring</string>
	...
</array>


AFDKO options
The OS/2, hhea, head, and name tables will be added to the features
file. The name table entry strings will be formatted according to OpenType
Feature File Specification § 9.e. Any strings unable to be formatted fully for
each platform's specific encoding restriction (Windows -- UTF-8, Macintosh --
Mac Roman) will be formatted to their nearest ASCII equivalent rather than
omitting any un-encodable characters. The standard library unicodedata module
is used for any entries meeting this criteria.

GlyphOrderAndAliasDB (GOADB) and FontMenuNameDB files can be generated for use
with MakeOTF. The GOADB can be provided (afdko_makeotf_GOADB_path), derived
from the .vfb's original encoding, or the order of the source font.

Optionally, the first 256 glyphs can be filled from the Windows-1252 or Mac
OS Roman code pages (afdko_makeotf_GOADB_win1252,
afdko_makeotf_GOADB_macos_roman). The first character of a generated GOADB
file will always start with the .notdef glyph. If a GOADB file is provided,
it is not checked for correctness. Commands to run MakeOTF for each generated
instance separately or all instances as a batch using the options
afdko_makeotf_cmd and afdko_makeotf_batch_cmd, respectively.

There are several explicit keyword options to enable specific MakeOTF switches.
For those not available via a keyword option, they should be defined as a list
of strings and passed to the afdko_makeotf_args option.

psautohint options
psautohint can be utilized for generating glyph hints after UFO generation.
Commands to run psautohint for each generated instance separately or all
instances as a batch using the options psautohint_cmd and
psautohint_batch_cmd, respectively. The default options are -d (write
decimal (float) hint coordinates) and -w (write hints directly to the .glif
lib for each glyph).

UFOZ options
UFO instances can be written as a .ufoz archive. If you are planning on any
file transfer operations after creation, transferring a single .ufoz file is
much quicker than the large number of small text files in the generated UFO
instance(s), especially when transferring through USB. By default, archives are
written in compressed mode. Compression can be turned off by setting
ufoz_compress to False.

.designspace font options
A .designspace document can be created in place of individual UFO instances.
A UFO for each master will be generated and the instances will be described in
the .designspace document. A default instance can be described with the
designspace_default option. This value must be a list or tuple with a value
for each axis in the font. If glyphs_omit_list or glyphs_omit_suffixes_list
lists are provided, the glyphs will remain in the source UFOs and a glyph mute
rule for each glyph to be omitted will be added for each instance.

Benchmarks
For reference, testing was performed on a Windows 10 machine with an Intel Xeon
E5 1650v3 @ 3.5 GHz CPU and a solid-state hard drive; CPUs with fewer cores
and/or a hard disk drive increases file write times considerably.

Times are per-instance (±.5 sec) and do not include time to load and parse user
options, then copy the original font and prepare the copy for conversion to the
UFO format. This prep time increases when not providing a FontLab-class
(.flc) or groups.plist file.

The ufoz option reduces build time considerably.

Notes
Generally, no assumptions are made about the correctness of the input. When
adfko_makeotf_release mode is set, glyph name errors will raise an exception
and UFO generation will not continue. Glyph name checks are made prior to
building instances. Other errors in the original font will likely be passed
through to the UFO.
